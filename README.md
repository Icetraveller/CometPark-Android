CometPark-Android
=================
Welcome to the CometPark-Android! This git repository is Android side of the whole project. And this [link][1] goes to GAE app project.

The **CometPark** project goal is to provide a solution to the UT Dallas campus parking problem, which includes the customization of hardware devices and sensors installed on each parking lot, implementation of cloud service and Android mobile application.

The application provides a smart ranking list that is based on available parking spots, user preferred permit type and distance to there, to advise the best parking lot as destination.

Once got there, a detailed built-in parking lot map (SVG, which will not loss any detail of the graphics when zoom in) will show you all available parking spots, and they update in real time.

The project uses Google App Engine with multiple APIs, including datastore(with objectify), Java Channel API, Google Cloud Message. And Google Map Api v2 with Google Map Projections of SVG graphics, Showcase View, and support libraries on the Android side.
